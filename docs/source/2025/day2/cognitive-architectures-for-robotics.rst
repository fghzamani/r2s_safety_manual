Keynote: Cognitive Architectures for Robust and Reliable Robotics
*****************************************************************
   *9:00 - 10:30* -- Esther Aguado

In this keynote, I will introduce the field of cognitive architectures: control frameworks that allow robots to reason, plan, and make decisions in intelligent and flexible ways.
I will begin by sharing my own journey into this area, then define what cognitive architectures are and explain why they are essential for achieving true autonomy in robots.

We will explore the key capabilities these systems must support, and examine how they are implemented in well-established cognitive architectures such as Soar, LIDA, and ACT-R.
I will also discuss current practical approaches to bridging high-level reasoning with low-level perception and action, through frameworks like CRAM/KnowRob and SkiROS.

To conclude, I will reflect on broader research challenges that continue to shape the field, including improving generalization across tasks and environments, enriching memory and understanding, and enhancing the integration of perception, control, and action.

This perspective aligns closely with the goals of the CoreSense project, which aims to design a robust and general-purpose cognitive architecture centered on perception, understanding, and awareness in autonomous robots.
The talk will highlight ongoing research efforts that support the vision of building autonomous systems that are resilient, transparent, and trustworthy.
