   *9:30 - 12:30* -- Jos√© Miguel Guerrero

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of ROS 2, including its architecture and core communication concepts.
Through hands-on activities, students will develop a ROS 2-based perception-decision-action loop that enables robots to detect obstacles and respond autonomously.
The course emphasizes practical experience in building autonomous robotic behaviors using modern, modular software tools.
