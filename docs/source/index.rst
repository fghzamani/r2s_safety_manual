0. Background Information
-------------------------
This manual applies to all lab spaces of the R2S, currently:

- Mobile Manipulation Lab
  - Location: 34.F-0-450
  - Contact: Carlos Hernandez Corbato
- AgriFood Lab
  - Location: RoboHouse
  - Contact: Chris Pek

1. General Conduct
------------------
- **Access:** Only authorized lab members may enter and operate equipment. Visitors must be accompanied.
- **Work hours:** Do not work alone outside regular hours (09:00–18:00).
- **Awareness:** Always be alert to the position and motion of robots. Avoid distractions (headphones, phone use) when robots are active.
- **Workspace:** Keep the 10×10 m area uncluttered. Do not block robot pathways or emergency exits.

2. Robot Operation

The manual of Albert can be found here:

- **Training required:** Only trained users may operate robots.
- **Powering on/off:** Follow official startup/shutdown procedures. Never hot-plug cables.
- **Operating zone:** Maintain a **2 m safety distance** around robots when active.
- **Emergency stop (E-Stop):**
  - Know the location of the robot’s hardware E-Stop buttons and wireless controller.
  - Press immediately if motion is unsafe or unexpected.
- **Speed limits:** Use reduced speed during experiments involving humans.
- **Supervision:** Robots must never run unattended.

3. Personal Safety
------------------
- **Clothing:** No loose clothing, scarves, jewelry, or dangling items near robots.
- **Hair:** Tie back long hair.
- **Protective gear:** Safety glasses are recommended when testing manipulation tasks involving objects.
- **Manual handling:** Do not manually force robot joints or wheels unless explicitly trained to do so.

4. Environment & Equipment
--------------------------
- **Desks:** Use designated desks for laptops and coding. Do not place food or drinks near robots or electronics.
- **Cables:** Route cables along walls or tape them down to prevent tripping.
- **Storage:** Keep tools, objects, and test items in designated shelves or bins.
- **Battery & charging:**
  - Charge robots only at approved stations.
  - Do not leave charging robots unattended overnight.

5. Emergencies
--------------
- **Emergency stops:** Press immediately if there is any risk to people or equipment.
- **Fire safety:** Know the nearest fire extinguisher and evacuation route. Do not use robots during evacuation.
- **Injury:** Report all injuries, even minor ones, to the lab supervisor.
- **Incident reporting:** Any accident, near-miss, or equipment damage must be documented and reported.

6. Responsibility
-----------------
Lab members are responsible for:

- Following this safety manual.
- Respecting shared equipment and workspace.
- Keeping the lab a safe and collaborative environment.

**Failure to comply may result in suspension of lab access.**

Key Rule of Thumb
-----------------
If in doubt, stop the robot and ask a supervisor.
